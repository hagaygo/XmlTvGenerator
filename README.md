XmlTv file Generator

This project/software purpose is to build a platform for generating xmltv file(s).

The software consists of two parts :

1.The main program.
2.Grabber extensions dll (assemblies).

By settings up the config.xml you can choose which grabbers will be used and define a parameters for each if them (if needed or relevant).
Each grabber is responsible for collecting the shows/programs data to a standard format model which then being parse to xmltv by the main program.

At the moment there are 2 grabbers ready in this repository , every .net programmer can add more by his own needs and have the option to share them with us in this repository.

Feel free to update the wiki page if needed.
